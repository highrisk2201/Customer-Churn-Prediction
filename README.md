# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using XGBoost
---
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project!  
This application predicts whether a customer will leave the bank or not based on key financial and personal features, using a powerful XGBoost machine learning model.

✅ Key Highlights:
- Built using XGBoost Classifier for high prediction accuracy.
- Integrated StandardScaler to maintain consistent feature scaling.
- Pickle files used for efficient model and scaler storage.
- Trained on real-world customer churn dataset (`Churn_Modelling.csv`).

# 🚀 Features

- 📈 Predicts customer churn based on financial parameters like Credit Score, Balance, and Salary.
- 💾 Model and scaler loaded dynamically using `pickle`.
- 📊 Clean preprocessing ensuring high model performance and reliability.
